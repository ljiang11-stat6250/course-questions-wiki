- *Question* (cli19−stat6250): What is the minimum number of times enclosed statements within a DO UNTIL condition executed?

- Question(dfei-stat6250): How many ways to add an unique ID to each row in dataset?
- *Question* (aacharya4−stat6250):  What is the purpose of using RETAIN statement in SAS?
- *Answer* (aacharya4−stat6250): In a DATA step, SAS sets the initial values of variables created by INPUT or assignment system as missing by default. The RETAIN statement overrides this default, so the value of the variable is retained when used with RETAIN statement.
- *Question* (asharda-stat6250): What is the use of where not statement?.
- *Question* (shatcher4-stat6250): Why would you use a retain attribute in a DO loop?
- *Question* (ldai4-stat6250): In using PROC mean statement, how can we calculate disaggregate statistics?
- Question (tbishaw-stat6250): Which SAS function do we use to execute disaggreagation? And what does Disaggreagation accomplish?  
- *Question*(kamirneni-stat6250): What does disaggregation accomplish and what function is used to define it?
- *Question* (cli19−stat6250): Can a single RETAIN statements be used to specify order of variables and to preserve variable values between DATA step iterations?
- Question (nshrivastava2-stat6250): Why is the initianlzation process relevant when no retain statement is involved?
- Question (ttruong59-stat6250): Why do we use RETAIN statements in the DO loop for this recipe? Is it mainly because we like to override the default values? 
- Question(tchan49-stat6250):What statement you might want to use when you don't want to count missing values? 
- Question (who7−stat6250): How is the second example different from the first example besides removing all missing value?
- *Question* (jcanfield3-stat6250): So the code just creates repeated lines of each record based on the value of Enrollment_K12 right?
- Question (ldeng11−stat6250): Why we should retain the student_record_counter as 0?
- Question (ljiang11−stat6250): What is the purpose to disaggregate data?
- *Question* (akrishnamurthy-stat6250): What is the use of RETAIN statement?
- *Question* (sbagdi-stat6250): How to pad character variable with the leading zeroes?
- *Answer* (sbagdi-stat6250): We can pad character variable with the leading zeroes by making use of Z4. format, which adds the leading zeroes.
